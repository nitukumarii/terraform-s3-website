3. ❌ Push to master Failed – Repository not found
Error:

5. ❌ Push Rejected – Remote Contains Work You Don't Have Locally
Error:
! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/...'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
Reason: The remote branch had changes not present in the local branch.
Solution:
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
